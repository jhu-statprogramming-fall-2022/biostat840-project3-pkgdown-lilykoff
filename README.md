Questions: the researchers seek to (1) quantify use of seven different tobacco products among U.S. high school and middle school aged adolescents and (2) investigate whether the prevalence of tobacco use has changed between 2011 and 2018. 

Random: I think this is an example of a design-based approach, where the inference relies on random sampling (as opposed to distributional assumptions). The randomness is in who is selected for participation and who responds to the survey, but conditional on selection, responses are not treated as random. In other words, the randomness comes from the three stage cluster sampling procedure that is used to generate the "nationally representative" sample of U.S. students in grades 6-12. The responses are then adjusted with weighting to reflect nonresponse and the survey design. 

Conclusions: the authors conclude that the use of e-cigarettes as driven an increase in the use of tobacco products from 2017-2018, while there was no siginficant increase in tobacco product use among either middle or high schoolers from 2011-2018.
